-- Draw a rising, moving, then setting sun, as in the sample animation 
-- https://code.world/run.html?mode=haskell&dhash=DYBPZOMntsydDgOvvqQNsPQ 
-- 
-- You need not have the exact same positions of the sun at the
-- beginning and end as in our sample animation. For example, the sun 
-- can start completely hidden behind the grass line, and can 
-- completely disappear behind the grass line at the end. But after
-- having set (Sonnenuntergang) it should stay where it is or
-- completely wink out of existence, not continue to move under the 
-- ground or other strange behavior. 
-- 
-- Do not try to "cheat" by letting the sun continue to move under the
-- ground but hiding it behind a white rectangle or anything similar. 
-- 
-- You can work with elementary trigonometry for this task. If you
-- need to refresh your knowledge of trigonometric functions and their
-- connection to circular motion, you may want to have a look at 
-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_circle as well as 
-- https://www.geogebra.org/m/Jgt2n9ah 
--
-- Of course, you can also work with CodeWorld's 'rotated' function 
-- instead. 
--
-- In any case, note that angles in CodeWorld are measured in radians,
-- not in degrees. 
-- 
-- Hint: Note that 'scene' is now a function from Double to Picture as 
--       opposed to just a Picture in Task01. This additional
--       parameter, here named t, is the number of seconds elapsed 
--       since the animation started. As additional help, the current 
--       value for t is displayed by the given template (confirming
--       that the program keeps running).
