module Task19 where

import CodeWorld
import Prelude hiding (($), (!!))

{- Brace yourself, since this is going to take a bit of
 - explaining. The thing is, we have a new customer, and that customer
 - has some strange wishes. But such is life as a software engineer.
 -
 - So this customer wants a certain test chart design, like this:
 - https://code.world/run.html?mode=haskell&dhash=D8vallegOLFOSRlLLYSvTkg
 -
 - The customer's specification mentions prime numbers. Fortunately,
 - we already have a definition of the infinite list of all prime
 - numbers readily at hand, from a previous project of our company:
 -}

-- To convince yourself that this definition is working, you might 
-- want to copy it into a different file, load that file into ghci, 
-- and run something like 'take 100 primes'. 
primes :: [Integer]
primes = sieve [2..]
  where sieve cs =
          let p = head cs
          in [ p ] ++ sieve [ c | c <- tail cs, c `mod` p /= 0 ]

{- What the customer wants to see on screen is: many 5-by-5 squares
 - with different colors, each square offset from the coordinate
 - system's origin by a prime number in the x-direction. How many such
 - squares there should be, and thus how much of the increasing
 - sequence of prime numbers to use, will be given as a parameter. For
 - example, the specific test chart linked to above uses the first 4
 - prime numbers. Due to the relative spacing of prime numbers,
 - specifically since they will often be closer than 5 to each other,
 - some squares will overlap. In that case, the customer wants the
 - squares created for smaller prime numbers to appear behind the ones
 - for larger prime numbers. That is, working with the first 4 prime
 - numbers again, the image should really be the one linked to above,
 - *not* the following one:
 - https://code.world/run.html?mode=haskell&dhash=Dex05jwjVg9D5ooT7tOybQg
 -
 - Where do we get enough different colors from?
 -
 - Well, fortunately CodeWorld provides exactly what we need, an
 - infinite list 'assortedColors :: [Color]' that we can use.
 -
 - So is that it? Not quite. Since, if we create a large amount of
 - squares this way, the overall image will quickly become larger
 - than the 20x20 coordinate plane of CodeWorld, the customer wants to
 - set an additional parameter for scaling the complete image up or
 - down (mostly down, with factors smaller than 1.0). So the first
 - image linked to above would be the outcome of 'scene 4 1.0', while
 - the following image would be the outcome of 'scene 10 0.3':
 - https://code.world/run.html?mode=haskell&dhash=DokcKG92ZCcopCeGgOxbEBA
 -}

scene :: Int -> Double -> Picture
scene number factor = undefined

main :: IO ()
main = drawingOf (coordinatePlane & scene 10 0.3)

{- Strange wishes by the customer indeed. But hey, the customer is
 - always king. And this customer is paying well.
 -
 - But wait. Unfortunately, there is not only customer-king, but also
 - technical-boss at our company. And this boss of yours is always
 - forward thinking and re-use oriented. "Maybe we will be able to use
 - part of the functionality here for another project later on", the
 - boss said. "So make things modular and as general as possible."
 -
 - Specifically, the instructions were that you should not simply
 - write a monolithic implementation of the 'scene' function above,
 - but actually decompose it into two functions, say 'f' and 'g', to
 - be used as follows for replacing the 'undefined' above:
 -
 -                      f ... (g ...)
 -
 - where 'f' takes some parameter(s) as well as a call to 'g', which
 - itself also takes some parameter(s). And the aim is that 'g' should
 - be *as polymorphic as possible*. So probably you should stuff
 - everything that has to do only with general list manipulation into
 - 'g' and everything that has to do more specifically with pictures
 - and colors etc. into 'f'.
 -
 - It is an essential part of your task to find a reasonable division
 - of work between 'f' and 'g' such that 'g' has a lot of polymorphism
 - (type variables in its type signature).
 -
 - Writing down the type signatures for your functions is mandatory.
 -
 - It would also be good to come up with some meaningful function
 - names for 'f' and 'g'. (The boss was not of much help in that
 - regard.)
 -
 - Also, do not use the !! operator or re-implementations of it.
