-- Suppose we want to implement a jump & run game. First off, we 
-- should care for level design. In a conceptually tiled world, a 
-- level can be thought of as a function assigning to each (x,y) 
-- position of the (assumed infinite) screen some number representing
-- what occupies that tile space. 
-- 
-- For example (note that this takes a pair as input, not two
-- individual coordinate values):

level :: (Integer, Integer) -> Integer
level (x, y)
  | abs x > 6 || abs y > 5             = 0  -- outside of the level
  | abs x == 6 || abs y == 5           = 1  -- for a block
  | y < 1 && x >= y && abs (x - 2) > 2 = 1
  | y < -1                             = 2  -- for water
  | abs y > 2 && abs (x + y - 1) > 5   = 3  -- for a pearl
  | x < -4 && y < 2                    = 3
  | otherwise                          = 4  -- for air

-- We want to produce an actual screen drawing from such a purely 
-- mathematical level description. Fortunately, our graphics designers 
-- have already done some work: 

block, water, pearl, air :: Picture

block = colored (light grey) (solidRectangle 1 1)

water = colored blue (solidRectangle 1 1)

pearl = colored purple (solidCircle 0.3) & air

air = colored (translucent blue) (solidRectangle 1 1)

-- But the remaining work rests with us. The first step is to turn
-- number codes 1, 2, ... used above into the corresponding 
-- pictures. That should not be too hard, right? But make sure that 
-- your implementation of the following function is total, i.e., gives
-- no non-exhaustiveness warning:

aTile :: Integer -> Picture
aTile = undefined

-- Then, we can use that function to produce the overall drawing of 
-- the level. Our visible screen has x-coordinates from -10 to 10, and 
-- likewise for y. And we should really call the 'aTile' function for 
-- all (x,y) combinations in that range, not just some smaller part of
-- the screen, because somebody on the team might still change the 
-- 'level' function to cover more of the visible screen with 
-- interesting stuff, and then we do not want to produce only a part
-- of the drawing.
-- 
-- So we would have to produce 21 * 21 = 441 individual calls to cover 
-- all (x,y) combinations. Surely you can do this more succinctly? 
--
-- If you are thinking of using recursion: don't! We have arts people 
-- on our game development team and don't want to blow their mind. 

scene :: Picture
scene = undefined

-- Extra: Design your own level by providing a different 'level'
--        function of type (Integer, Integer) -> Integer.

main :: IO ()
main = drawingOf scene
