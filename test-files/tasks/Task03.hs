--   https://code.world/run.html?mode=haskell&dhash=DantMBam23_YjOgmx241lZw
--
-- Your picture should consist of an oval gray shell surrounding the
-- egg white which has a round, yellow yolk inside.
--
-- (Mathematically, the egg form can simply be an ellipse/stretched circle.)
--
-- You can look up how to produce and transform relevant shapes in the
-- CodeWorld documentation and in the example(s) from the lecture.
