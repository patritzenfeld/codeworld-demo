-- Some animation functions are given, and you are not allowed to 
-- change them: 

animation1 :: Double -> Picture
animation1 t
  | t < 2     = colored red (circle t)
  | otherwise = blank

animation2 :: Double -> Picture
animation2 t
  | t < 3     = rectangle t (t + 2)
  | otherwise = blank

animation3 :: Double -> Picture
animation3 t
  | t < 2     = solidCircle (t / 2)
  | otherwise = blank

-- The following program overlays these animations. Unfortunately, 
-- that is not exactly what we want. We want the animations to be
-- "played" one after another, and only afterwards do we want the end 
-- notice to be shown. Moreover, we want to scale 'animation2' by a 
-- size factor of 2, and we want 'animation3' to be played at half
-- speed.
-- 
-- The outcome should look as follows:

-- 
-- But remember: You are not allowed to change anything in the 
-- definitions of 'animation1', 'animation2' and 'animation3'
-- themselves. You should use them unchanged. And if someone else were
-- to change them, your code in 'scene' should still work with them 
-- (assuming that said someone else has not changed the individual 
-- animations' durations). 
--
-- Of course you *are* allowed to change the conceptual structure and 
-- the content of the 'scene' function. But, as always desirable, do 
-- make sure that your code causes no non-exhaustiveness warnings.
--
-- There is no need for adding new functions, only change 'scene'.
